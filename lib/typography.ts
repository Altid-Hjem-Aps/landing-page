// Central type scale for the CVI rebuild.
//
// Each constant is a verified Tailwind className string for a text role
// that's used identically across multiple sections. Import it instead of
// retyping the size/weight/line-height/tracking combo at each call site, so
// sections sharing a role can't quietly drift apart again — that's exactly
// how WaitlistForm's light and dark variants ended up with two different
// treatments for the same "form step heading" and "primary button" roles
// before this file existed.
//
// Colour, margin, text-align, and layout width are intentionally NOT
// included — those vary legitimately per section/background and stay on
// the call site. Compose like: `${H2} mb-6` with `style={{ color }}`.

// Fluid ramps are two-point interpolations anchored at 390px → min and
// 1920px → max (slope = (max−min)/1530). The earlier pure-vw slopes hit
// their minimum as early as ~1077px, so every iPad/phone width rendered the
// same flattened scale while desktop stayed fluid — that's why the page felt
// inconsistent off-desktop. The 1920px values are unchanged.
